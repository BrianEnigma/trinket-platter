#Trinket Platter

This is a simple 3D printed platter to hold the Adafruit Trinket, a power jack, and a wire strain relief. The STL file as well as the OpenSCAD source are available.

Although this design has a 90-degree corner, that corner has a lot of strain-relief. The outside edges have quarter-circles. The inside corner edge is rounded, not sharp.

#Parts

Hardware you will have to supply:

- An [Adafruit Trinket](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1501)
- A panel-mount power jack. Mine was a standard Arduino 2.1mm jack. Unfortunately, I can't tell you where to get one exactly like mine. It was in my parts bin, possibly from Radio Shack, possibly from Digikey. The through-hole threaded portion has a 7.6mm outside diameter. The panel hole is just a bit larger than that. If you need to adjust the hole size, it's easy to find the value in the OpenSCAD source file.
- M2 screws and nuts to attach the Trinket. Both the [screws][] and [nuts][] I used were from McMaster-Carr.
- A zip-tie to hold and act as strain-relief for any wires going to and from the Trinket. Just zip-tie any wires to the oval hole.
